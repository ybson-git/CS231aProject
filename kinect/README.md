# kinect
In case you are interested in Azure Kinect, you can purchase it https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kinect-dk/ and install K4A SDK from https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK.  

For this project we have RBG color image (.png) in 720p format and its corresponding depth image (.npy) captured previously.  
Just run `process_kinect.py` to get image processed.
